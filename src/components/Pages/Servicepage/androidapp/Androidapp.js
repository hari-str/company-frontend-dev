          <p>
            The official language for Android development is Java. Large parts
            of Android are written in Java and its APIs are designed to be
            called primarily from Java. It is possible to develop C and C++ app
            using the Android Native Development Kit (NDK), however it isn't
            something that Google promotes.
            <p>
              Android software development is the process by which new
              applications are created for devices running the Android operating
              system. Google states that[3] "Android apps can be written using
              Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages" using the Android software
              development kit (SDK), while using other languages is also
              possible. All non-JVM languages, such as Go, JavaScript, C, C++ or
              assembly, need the help of JVM language code, that may be supplied
              by tools, likely with restricted API support. Some
              languages/programming tools allow cross-platform app support.

              Android apps are built as a combination of components that can be
              invoked individually. For example, an activity is a type of app
              component that provides a user interface. The "main" activity is
              what starts when the user taps your app icon, but you can take the
              user straight into a different activity from other places, such as
              from a notification or even from a different app. Other components
              such as broadcast receivers and services also allow your app to
              perform background tasks without a user interface.
