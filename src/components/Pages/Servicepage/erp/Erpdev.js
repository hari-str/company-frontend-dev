          <h1>Enterprise resource planning (ERP)</h1>
          <p>
            ERP system, which stands for Enterprise-Resource Planning, is
            necessary for every modern company to take care of all aspect of a
            business. It’s a master of all ! But the main issue is that ERPs
            sometimes prove to be complex and expensive due to cost of the
            system, hardware and consulting fees. In such cases, web-based ERP
            solution costs you less bucks to implement and maintain.
          </p>

          <p>
            Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) is business management software
            that integrates all the data on business processes and resources
            (product planning, manufacturing, purchasing, delivery, marketing,
            sales, finance, human resources etc.) and can be used by large,
            medium, and small businesses. In addition, nowadays each ERP system
            should be created according to the specific requirements and needs
            of the individual enterprise. As a rule, small and medium businesses
            acquire lightweight ERP applications that have a specific set of
            functions (features) to meet the needs of a certain business
            vertical. The creation of powerful custom ERP software that covers
            all the business processes and roles of a large enterprise requires
            a dedicated team of experienced developers and analytics.

              <li>
                Preparation for implementation; The first stage of our
                development process includes consulting, identification of
                project scope, number of modules needed etc. We start with
                understanding and deep analysis of your organization’s strategy
                and existing business processes and then offer you an ERP
                solution based on your specific needs and requirements.

                Configuration; We continue with designing your ERP system. As a
                rule, we use two-tier development approach – we create ERP
                software that has two levels: corporate and subsidiary
                (department) levels. In this way, each department remains
                independent, concentrating on its core business operations, but
                at the same time all of them are integrated in one common
                system.
              </li>
              <li>
                Customization (optional) ; We offer such configuration options
                that incorporate your business rules and practices to deliver
                the most suitable ERP feature set. By customizing your ERP
                software, you don’t lose your competitive advantage as opposed
                to the organizations that use standard ERP functionality.
